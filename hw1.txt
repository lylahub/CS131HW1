Q1
The `subset` function in OCaml uses recursion to check if list `a` is a subset of list `b`, adhering to OCaml's functional programming style. Alternatives like iterative solutions and using set structures were considered but rejected due to complexity and deviation from list-based operations. While this approach is concise and idiomatic, it may struggle with large lists due to its O(n*m) complexity and risk of stack overflow in deep recursive calls, making it suitable primarily for smaller datasets.

Q2
The `equal_sets` function in OCaml determines if two lists represent the same set by checking if each list is a subset of the other, using the `subset` function. This approach utilizes logical and functional clarity by employing an existing function, avoiding the need for additional complex operations such as sorting or hash table conversions. However, the main limitation is its computational inefficiency for large datasets due to the double invocation of the `subset` function, each with O(n*m) complexity, making it suitable mainly for moderate-sized data.

Q3
The `set_union` function in OCaml effectively constructs the union of two lists, `a` and `b`, by recursively appending elements from `a` to `b` if they are not already present, ensuring all elements from both lists are included in the result. This method, while straightforward and easy to implement, involves appending elements directly to `b`, potentially adding duplicate elements if `b` already contains some elements from `a`. It lacks a check for duplicates, which might be necessary for a true set operation, especially if maintaining a set with unique elements is crucial. Thus, this implementation is best suited for scenarios where either list uniqueness is managed externally or duplicates are acceptable. However, I am not sure whether we need to generate the list in what order since it was not specified in the question or shown in sample test cases.

Q4
The `set_all_union` function in OCaml utilizes `List.fold_left` to compute the union of a set of sets (`a`), where each element of `a` is itself a list. This function effectively applies the previously defined `set_union` to accumulate a single list representing the union of all contained sets, starting with an empty list. By leveraging `fold_left` with `set_union`, it iteratively combines all nested lists into one, handling an arbitrary number of sets within `a`. This approach is efficient for merging multiple sets but retains the limitations of the `set_union` regarding potential duplicate elements if the `set_union` function does not inherently handle duplicates.

Q5
The function `self_member` is conceptually impossible to implement in OCaml due to type constraints inherent in the language. In OCaml, for a set `s` to contain itself, `s` would need to be a list that includes itself as an element, creating a type mismatch. Specifically, if `s` is of type `'a list`, then for `s` to contain itself, `s` would also need to be of type `'a`, leading to a recursive type requirement that OCaml's type system does not support. This restriction is due to OCaml's statically typed nature, which ensures type safety and prevents such recursive type definitions to avoid inconsistencies and potential runtime errors.

Q6
The `computed_fixed_point` function in OCaml efficiently finds the fixed point of a function `f` starting from an initial value `x`, using an equality predicate `eq` to determine when the fixed point is reached. The function checks if the value `x` equals `f(x)` based on the `eq` predicate, and if they are equal, it returns `x` as the fixed point; otherwise, it recursively applies `f` and checks again. This implementation is direct and effective, but it assumes that `f` will eventually stabilize to a fixed point, as it does not handle cases where `f` continuously changes without stabilizing, which could lead to infinite recursion or stack overflow errors in practical scenarios where no fixed point exists.

Q7
The `computed_periodic_point` function in OCaml finds a periodic point for a function `f` with a set period `p` starting from `x`, using an equality check `eq`. It uses a helper function `apply` to apply `f` `p` times to `x`. If `x` matches the result after `p` applications, it returns `x` as the periodic point. Otherwise, it keeps applying `f` to find the right point. This approach assumes that a periodic point exists and may result in endless loops if it doesn't.

Q8
The `whileseq` function in OCaml generates the longest list starting from `x` where each subsequent element is derived by applying a function `s` to the previous element, and all elements satisfy a condition `p`. The function recursively constructs the list by appending `x` to the list result of applying `whileseq` to `s x`, only if `p x` is true. If `p x` is false, it immediately returns an empty list. This mechanism ensures that the list contains consecutive elements starting from `x` that all meet the condition `p` until one does not, effectively stopping the sequence. This implementation is efficient for generating sequences under conditions that are eventually false, avoiding infinite loops.

Q9
The `filter_blind_alleys` function in OCaml is designed to refine a grammar by removing blind-alley rules, which are production rules that cannot derive a string consisting solely of terminal symbols. The solution uses multiple helper functions to achieve this: it begins by identifying all symbols that can derive terminal strings using `terminable_symbol_list`, which iteratively checks if the right-hand side (rhs) of each rule only contains symbols that can derive terminals. This check is facilitated by `rhs_terminability`, which recursively confirms that every symbol in the rhs is either a terminal or a nonterminal that can ultimately lead to terminals.

Once the list of terminable symbols is established, the main function uses `final_list` to repeatedly apply `rules_symbols` until no new terminable symbols are added, effectively finding a fixed point of symbols that can derive terminals. The grammar is then filtered by `remove_rules`, which only retains rules where the rhs is fully terminable. This method ensures that the output grammar has no blind alleys while preserving the order of the original rules. By processing the grammar in this manner, the function addresses the requirement of refining grammars to remove unproductive rules efficiently while ensuring the grammar still generates the same language.
